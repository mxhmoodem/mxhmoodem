🔧 Originally from a mechanical engineering background, I'm pivoting into the dynamic world of software engineering and web development. The mechanics of code fascinate me just as much as physical machines!

🔭 I’m currently working on some exciting web development projects and lloking for a software/tech bootcamp to expand my knowledge even further!

🌱 I’m in the process of expanding my software toolkit. From web development using HTML and CSS to making games in Python, every day is a new learning experience and I'm loving the journey.

👯 Open to collaborations! If you have a project that could use a unique blend of engineering and coding skills, let's chat.

💡 I’m seeking mentorship and advice from experienced developers. Got tips for a transitioning engineer? I’m all ears.

💬 Ask me how transitioning from mechanical engineering has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving in the software realm.

⚡ Fun fact: I can draw parallels between the torque in an engine and the torque in a piece of code (just kidding... or am I?).
