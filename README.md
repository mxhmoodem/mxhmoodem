# Hi, I'm Mahmood! ðŸ‘‹


Originally from a Mechanical Engineering background, I'm now diving deep into software engineering, AI/ML and web development. My passion for problem-solving has transitioned from physical machines to writing clean and efficient code.


ðŸ’¡ What I'm Up To:

- Software Engineering: Experienced with Angular, React and Node.js, Iâ€™ve developed customer-facing web applications and collaborated with cross-functional teams on large-scale projects.

- Embedded Systems & Control: Designed an automatic yaw control system for a miniature wind turbine, integrating sensors and microcontrollers with C/C++ and Arduino.

- Data & Simulation: Worked on techno-economic analysis using Python and MATLAB, researching zero-carbon fuels and vehicle powertrain simulations.

- Full-Stack Development: Built projects like face detection appsÂ using APIs and developed websites for local businesses.

ðŸ‘¯ Letâ€™s Collaborate! If you have a project where mechanical engineering meets software, Iâ€™m always open to innovative ideas.

ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:

- How my engineering background gives me a unique perspective in software development.

- My experience working in FinTech, sustainable energy and AI-driven applications.
